# Vanilla JS Chatapp!

## Welcome
Hi! I started this project to showcase the use of the Mediator Pattern to manage interaction between decoupled objects. This is done through the use of a simulated chat Application!

## Setup
This program is built with webpack. Make sure to run the following commands.
`npm install && npm run build`

That will bundle the code to build it to be serve to the html file.

## Enjoy!
